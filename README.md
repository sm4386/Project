# Proposed Project

Scientific question: How significant is temperature polarization during the novel operation of membrane distillation termed isothermal membrane distillation, IMD? 

Hypothesis: Temperature polarization is less significant in IMD than in conventional membrane distillation due to a decrease in conductive and convective heat transfer. 

In the analysis, I plan to utilize datasets (attached) that contain the bulk feed and collector temperatures on the inlet and outlet of the membrane (4 temperatures total) over time during different operating schemes of membrane distillation (isothermal and conventional). Additionally, I will utilize the flux of water and ammonia, which were measured experimentally, as well as measured membrane characteristics. From here, I will calculate the convective and conductive heat transfers using the experimental temperature profiles, experimental fluxes, membrane characteristics, and heat transfer models. Then, I am able to visualize the bulk and interfacial temperature profiles under each operation as well as the apparent driving force for vapor permeation under each operation.
